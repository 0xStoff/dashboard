fetch data across different chains (evm, cosmos, sol)
more convenient to track different tokens for me. 

### Features:
- EVM chains from Rabby
- Sol and Cosmos from PublicNode
- Track different wallets
- Add tags and balances specifying wallets used
- Pie chart with overview
- Filter by wallet and/or chain
- Local Storage to save API requests

### up next:
- implement own db (postgres)
- unify data structure
